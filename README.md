# Raspberry Pi Traffic Lights
## Overview

The traffic light follows the sequence for a steady traffic light and allows for a pedestrian crosswalk. The light remains steady until "someone" pushes the button. After which, the green light changes to yellow as with most traffic lights and then changes to red. The light stays red for a certain amount of time which allows the pedestrian to cross the road safely and then it moves back to green. 

## Materials Used
* Raspberry Pi
* Breadboard
* 1 resistor (220 ohm)
* 3 LEDs (1 red, 1 yellow. 1 green)
* 1 push button
* 5 male-to-female jumper wires
* 3 male to male jumper wires


The images below show the wiring diagram as well as the schematics for the traffic light.
